# New (-ly forked) ProgHacknight Website!

We're so excited to launch this new website forked from the good folks at ChiHacknight. This website aims to make more information available to our awesome participants, and provide a deeper context on the ongoing works in the progressive space.

## What's new

We've added new features to this website. Including:

* **Event details pages.** You can now see upcoming and past speakers. Julian Rad and Tino Bedi has been documenting our speakers, with the whole community collaboratively taking notes. [Checkout the events page!](/events)

* **Breakout groups.** We are now listing all the breakout groups, both discussion and working groups. We want this information available anytime, and in the future provide a detailed list of all the progressive tech projects being worked on in New York. [Checkout the breakout pages!](/breakout-groups)

* **Project Pages.** we are now featuring the projects being developed in ProgHacknight! We want to feature and honor the awesome work of our participants and provide them the spotlight they deserve! [Checkout the project page here](/projects).

* **Steering committee.** Get to know the people behind the event! Checkout the [team bio here](/steering-committee).
