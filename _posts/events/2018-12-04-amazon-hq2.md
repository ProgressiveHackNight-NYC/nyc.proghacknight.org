For our last hacknight for 2018, we will talk about the biggest elephant in the (NYC) room: Amazon HQ2. Tech workers will undoubtedly benefit from the presence of one of tech industry’s biggest companies, owned by the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos. Amazon HQ2 also includes a $3,000,000,000 tax-incentive—an amount not given to any other tech company in New York.

There are so many layers to this discussion: from [Amazon’s role in supporting ICE](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/06/22/amazon-employees-demand-company-cut-ties-with-ice/), to [bad](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html) [working](https://observer.com/2018/04/amazon-britain-harsh-working-conditions/) [conditions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/technology/amazon-wristband-tracking-privacy.html) that have [caused strikes across Europe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-strikes-germany/amazon-workers-strike-in-germany-spain-on-black-friday-idUSKCN1NS1AU), to how their move here will [hike up rent prices in New York](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/11/14/18091872/amazon-hq2-long-island-city-home-rent-prices-nyc-predictions) and add further pressure to our already crumbling transit system. Ultimately, this is equally a reflection of Amazon’s role in today’s society as it is a reflection of us: tech workers. How is our industry affecting society, and how should we hold our industry accountable? We ought to have an honest discussion about the role we play and what positive impact we can create. [Tech workers have already started to do a no work for Amazon pledge](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/no-work-for-amazon-new-york-1).

We will be joined by organizers and activists who are all leading a coalition of organizations (including Progressive HackNight) who are fighting back and saying “No Amazon, no way!” We will learn about the side that has been ignored throughout the Amazon HQ2 process: the people of New York City
