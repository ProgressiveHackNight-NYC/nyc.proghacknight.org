Last week, we had a huge gathering of tech workers discussing climate change: how organizations are demonstrating on the streets, and lobbying for legislation that will solve the climate crisis that we are currently in. [The Climate Mobilization](https://www.theclimatemobilization.org), [Extinction Rebellion](https://xrebellion.org/nyc), [Sunrise Movement](https://sunrisemovement.org), and [Justice Democrats](https://justicedemocrats.com) are all working towards a clear path to combat the climate crisis we're facing.

As tech workers, we have got to support the important work being done to fix the climate crisis. Here are things you can do right now:

-   If you haven't yet, [join the Progressive HackNight slack](http://bit.ly/joinHackNight) and join the #climate-manatweeter to organize and work on a twitter bot that will call out journalist that don't connect the dots of the atrocities they cover to #ClimateBreakdown.

-   On February 5, [Sunrise NYC will have a #GreenNewDeal livestream party](https://www.facebook.com/events/776068426074419/) that will kickoff the Sunrise Movement national campaign for a Green New Deal.

-   This Saturday, Xtinction Rebellion will have a national day of action. [Join the event here](https://xrebellion.org/nyc)

Next week is a Working HackNight -- which means there'll be no speakers, but we're going to work on a open-source projects, discuss strategies to help grassroots organizations, and learn from each other.

If you have a project, please [create an issue](https://github.com/ProgressiveHackNight/project-ideas/issues/new) at our [Projects Page](https://github.com/ProgressiveHackNight/project-ideas). We're looking forward to working with you! We'll have a list of breakouts on Monday next week.
