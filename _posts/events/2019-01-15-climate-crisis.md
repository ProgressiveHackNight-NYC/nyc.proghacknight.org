There's no sugarcoating it: if there are no aggressive climate policy change in the immediate future, we will see the end of humanity as we know it. If we won't upend the rise of earth's temperature, we will continue towards a climate catastrophe and see more famine, severe weather conditions, and civil unrest.

Out of all this, young people will will suffer the most. Young people would have to carry the burden of the decisions of politicians who effectively have the youth's lives on their hands.

To push for reform, [many have rallied to pressure their governments to join](https://peoplesclimate.org/) the [Paris Accord](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement), but even then, it is still not enough. Most recently, in London, after massive rallies and direct action campaigns organized by a group called [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/), the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, [announced a state of climate emergency, effectively putting the crisis front and center](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/11/london-mayor-sadiq-khan-city-climate-emergency). The effectivity of the tactic [is catching up in America](https://theintercept.com/2018/12/15/extinction-rebellion-nyc-climate-activism/): on January 26, climate activists will have a national day of action to [combat the climate catastrophe](https://www.facebook.com/events/755872278100977/) organized by Extinction Rebellion US.

Other groups are organizing to directly engage with their electeds. The [Sunrise Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org)  are organizing young people to pressure congress to create a sustainable solution for the crisis. Climate advocates are starting to rally around the [Green New Deal](https://www.sierraclub.org/trade/what-green-new-deal) --- a massive federal green jobs guarantee program ---  to curb the crisis. The jobs program is being championed by the Sunrise Movement, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and [Justice Democrats](http://www.justicedemocrats.com), with allies such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Rep. Ro Khanna, among others.

Our meeting in Tuesday will have a laser-focus on the crisis: how bad it is right now (spoiler: really really bad), what solutions are possible, and how does the landscape look like for those fighting for sustainable green policy from within Washington DC, and outside on the streets.
