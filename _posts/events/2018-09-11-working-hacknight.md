This HackNight will not have a speaker, so it’s full-on hacking and learning!

Start a new breakout group or meet up with an existing one. Feel free to use the space provided to us by ThoughtWorks NYC. Our directors and organizers will be available throughout the HackNight to provide support, collaborate, or a sounding board for your projects. Help us reserve a space for your group by [announcing your breakout group](https://github.com/ProgressiveHackNight/project-ideas).
