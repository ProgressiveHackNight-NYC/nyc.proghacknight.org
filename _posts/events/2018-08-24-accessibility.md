As volunteers in progressive and civic spaces, it’s our goal and responsibility to create technology that works for everyone. All people should be able to use the tools we build and access information that we share. We want our projects to be as inclusive as our community, and a reflection of our values and culture at Progressive HackNight.

To learn more about how you can design and build tech for all, join us on August 28 for an Accessibility HackNight! We’ll begin with two speakers committed to changing the culture and conversation, starting with **Thomas Logan**, the founder of [Equal Entry](https://equalentry.com/), which audits technology and aims to improve public education about accessibility. We’ll also be joined by **Xian Horn** to speak from her experience as an advocate, teacher, speaker, blogger with Cerebral Palsy, and discuss her work as an Exemplar with [AT&T NYU Connect Ability Challenge](https://connectability.devpost.com/), a global software development competition leveraging mobile and wireless technologies to improve the lives of people living with disabilities.
