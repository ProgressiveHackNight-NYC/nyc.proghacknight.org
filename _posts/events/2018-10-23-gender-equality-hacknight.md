There has been a huge shift in how we think about gender equality. The #MeToo movement has empowered sexual assault survivors to stand up and fight for justice. [There are now laws on Pay Equity in New York State](https://labor.ny.gov/formsdocs/factsheets/pdfs/p828.pdf) and is pressuring companies to rethink their biases. And just this year, New York passed the nation’s strongest [Paid Family Leave](https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/) that allows maternity leave for upto 12 weeks by 2021.

Still, a lot of work needs to be done. 114-million American workers still do not have paid family leave. Internationally, women spend 118 minutes more than men on routine household work and caregiving. Furthermore, America ranks 49th (down from 45th) in the 2017 Global Gender Gap report.

Join us on October 23 as Sherry Hakimi, executive director of genEquality, and Che Nembhard, Program Assistant at Promundo-US, talk about the issues and challenges on the road towards gender equality — and their work on tech and design — to achieve equality for all genders.

[genEquality](https://www.genequality.org/) cultivates a community of action-oriented people who do the difference for gender equality at home, at work, and everywhere in between. They do these through their products and events that help promote gender equality. Most recently, they staged a [hackathon to encourage the creation of technologies](https://www.genequality.org/hackathon/) that promote gender equality.

[Promundo](https://promundoglobal.org/) works to promote gender equality and prevent violence by engaging men and boys in partnership with women and girls. Our programs, campaigns, and advocacy efforts across the themes below are based in rigorous research, including the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES), and are designed to improve the lives of people around the world.
