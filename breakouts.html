<h1><i class='fa fa-group'></i> Breakout groups</h1>

<p>Every hacknight after the presentation, we break out into topic-specific working and discussion groups led by regular facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and build teams for civic apps. The groups are split into two types: <a href='#working'>working</a> groups and <a href='#discussion'>discussion</a> groups.</p>

<p>Want to start your own breakout group? Just announce it at the next hack night and people will vote with their feet!</p>

<p>Our breakout groups focus on mobilizing tech workers to discuss, strategize and create technology that dismantles structures of injustice and inequality. Our projects are developed in service to organizations without institutional monetary support. . Groups can last for one night or several years - it's up to you!</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting involved in a breakout group, contact the project leader from their Github issue below, <a href="http://bit.ly/joinProgHackNight">join our Slack</a> to connect with them directly, or keep an eye out for them at one of our future HackNights.</p>

    <p>Sometimes groups get marked as <code>closed</code> if they haven't been active in a few weeks. This is to keep the list size managable. Any group marked this way can be re-opened at any time.</a></p>

    <p>To re-open a group:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Visit the <a href='https://github.com/ProgressiveHacknight/breakout-groups/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed' target='_blank'>list of closed Github Issues</a>.</li>
      <li>Search for your project and click on it.</li>
      <li>You will see all the project notes and comments previously left. Scroll to the bottom of the page you'll see a box that allows you to leave a comment. Next to the comment button there should be a 'Reopen Issue' button. </li>
      <li>We recommend leaving a comment while you re-open the issue, to update the project and mention if you're looking for anything new!</li>
    </ol>
