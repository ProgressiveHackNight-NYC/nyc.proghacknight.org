<h1><i class='fa fa-group'></i> Breakout groups</h1>

<p>
  Every HackNight, we break out into topic-specific working and learning groups led by regular facilitators <br/><br/>
  We have two types of groups: learning groups and working groups. Learning groups meet to learn new skills, strategize about important issues, and refine their ideas. Working groups provide opportunities for our members to use their skills by actively building technology and tools.
</p>

<p>Our breakout groups focus on mobilizing tech workers to discuss, strategize and create technology that dismantles structures of injustice and inequality. Our projects are developed in service to organizations without institutional monetary support. . Groups can last for one night or several years - it's up to you!</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting involved in a breakout group, contact the project leader from their Github issue below, <a href="http://bit.ly/joinHackNight">join our Slack</a> to connect with them directly, or keep an eye out for them at one of our future HackNights.</p>

    <p>Sometimes groups get marked as <code>closed</code> if they haven't been active in a few weeks. Any group marked this way can be re-opened at any time.</a></p>

    <p>To re-open a group:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Visit the <a href='https://github.com/ProgressiveHacknight/breakout-groups/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed' target='_blank'>list of closed Github Issues</a>.</li>
      <li>Search for your project and click on it.</li>
      <li>You will see all the projectâ€™s prior notes and comments. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and you'll see a box that allows you to leave a comment. Next to the comment button, there should be a 'Reopen Issue' button.</li>
      <li>We recommend leaving a comment while you re-open the issue, to update the project and mention if you're looking for anything new!</li>
